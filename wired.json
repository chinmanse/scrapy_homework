The disease is highly contagious and can be dangerous in babies, young children, and even adults. The measles virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can linger for up to two hours in an airspace.", "“No matter how healthy you are at baseline, it very efficiently enters the body through the upper airway,” says Glenn Fennelly, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and assistant vice president for global health at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso.", "In the lungs, the virus enters a type of white blood cell called alveolar macrophages, which transport pathogens to the lymph nodes. Typically, the lymph nodes act as a drainage system, removing foreign substances. But when the measles virus gets shuttled to lymph tissue, the virus attacks and destroys an important part of the immune system called memory cells. These memory cells remember prior infections and help the body fight pathogens it’s encountered before. When memory cells get wiped out, it leaves an individual more susceptible to future infections.", "The phenomenon is known as immune amnesia, and it can leave people vulnerable to other infections for several weeks to months.

About one in five people who get sick with measles in the US is hospitalized, and one in 20 will develop pneumonia. In some cases, patients may need supplemental oxygen or intubation and ventilator support.", "In a ", ", Ron Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, described the hospitalized patients as having severe symptoms, with many of them also experiencing dehydration and low oxygen levels due to inflammation in the lungs.", "“Pneumonia is the most common cause of death for measles in young children,” says Edith Bracho-Sanchez, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.", "Measles can also cause a severe complication called encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Encephalitis can happen during an infection if the virus travels to the brain, or after an infection if the brain becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response. About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis. The condition can cause convulsions and in rare cases, deafness or intellectual disability.", "The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect against these complications.

However, large doses of vitamin A can be toxic.", "Secretary of health and human services Robert F.

Encephalitis can happen during an infection if the virus travels to the brain, or after an infection if the brain becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response. About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis. The condition can cause convulsions and in rare cases, deafness or intellectual disability.", "The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect against these complications.

Air pollution levels, estimated by satellite measurements, also dropped.", "In the long run, Jha’s research also found that the program actually saves money for the State Department, which is required to pay diplomats extra compensation for living in more hazardous environments. “Our estimates indicate that the monitors save the median embassy roughly $34,000 a year in this kind of hardship payments,” Jha says.", "Even beyond the hardship compensation, creating a world where fewer people are dying from diseases linked to air pollution would reduce the need for things like costly medical treatments. “In terms of benefits of this program relative to its costs, It’s a clear winner,” Jha says."]},

(IM-2 wasn't the only craft to recently land on the moon—earlier this week, ", " successfully touched down.)", "While Nokia's 4G network couldn't be deployed as planned, the company is still claiming it “delivered the first cellular network to the moon\" since it \"validated key aspects of the network's operation.” Inside Athena were several instruments and rovers along with Nokia's Network in a Box (NIB). In an interview at ", ", John Dow told WIRED this box is comprised of the radio, base station, routing, and core, all integrated into a compact system. He's the general manager of Nokia Bell Labs' Space Communications Systems.", "Nokia says it successfully powered up the NIB, which received commands and transmitted data to Intuitive Machines' ground station on Earth. All system components were fully functional, though it was online for only about 25 minutes until the power went out. The company had planned to make the first cellular call on the moon with the rovers, but the vehicles weren't deployed.", "What was supposed to happen? A few hours after landing, and after system checks, Athena's garage door would've opened and its onboard vehicles released. After traversing on the lunar surface, the rovers would have extended their antennas and connected to the network. “Think of it like a connected vehicle,\" Dow says. \"It has user equipment that we built that will connect with a 4G link to the network in a box on Athena.”", "One of these vehicles was the ", ", nicknamed Grace, from Intuitive Machines—it was designed to hop into a permanently shadowed moon crater to take pictures and readings, looking for potential signs of water ice.", "Any data collected would have been transferred back to the NIB on Athena, which would have transferred it to Earth via a long-haul satellite uplink. (That trip to Earth takes about a second and a half.) Dow says the rovers were supposed to travel under 2 kilometers away from Athena (around 1.2 miles), which is how far the broadband connectivity will be supported. If Lunar Outpost mission controllers in Colorado were to send commands to the rovers, the data would have traveled via Intuitive Machine's direct-to-Earth data transmission service to Athena and dispersed through the 4G network.", "While the 4G LTE flavor is the same as on Earth, Nokia's Lunar Surface Communications System was optimized for space travel, with several redundancies to recover from potential hardware or electronic failures (lack of power was not one of them). Nokia's components were replaced with lighter materials when possible. For example, the company says it replaced a heavy cavity filter with a ceramic-based solution, reducing its weight by five times. Nokia also says it designed a thermal management solution that handles “excess heat through conduction and radiation” since it can't use atmosphere-dependent convection used in electronics on Earth.", "This 4G NIB had a shorter than planned shelf life, but even if the mission had been successful, the NIB would still be short-lived. Dow says it wasn't meant to survive the harsh lunar night, which starts in about 9 days (a lunar day and a lunar night are each the equivalent of around 14 Earth days). In fact, the entire IM-2 mission was planned to end at this time, as the equipment's solar cells wouldn't have the energy to power the devices. For the Artemis III mission, the network and modules in the spacesuits will be built to survive the extreme temperatures of the moon, which can get as hot as 250 degrees Fahrenheit or as cold as -208 degrees.", "Over time, the goal is to establish ", ". “Once you have robust connectivity, you can see how you can have a basic infrastructure to support all the visions people talk about,\" Dow says. \"As you see the scaling of travel to the lunar surface, then you'll have inhabitants,\" Dow says. “Ultimately, it will get to the point where you no longer have to bring the network with you, you just have to bring the device because the network's there.”", "The 4G LTE communications that will be integrated into the Axiom spacesuit in the future will be able to communicate from astronaut to lander and astronaut to lander to astronaut. There won't be a smartphone for astronauts to hold up to their head. “It'll be a little like driving in your car hands-free,” says Russell Ralston, the executive vice president of Extravehicular Activity at Axiom Space. The microphones in the suit will be voice activated, and the network will be able to handle multiple real-time HD video streams, not to mention telemetry and data from the built-in sensors.", "So why not 5G? The current generation mobile network ", " over its predecessor, after all. Dow says development for space takes a long time and that Nokia wanted to start with technology that has been robustly tested. At the time, 5G was still in its early adoption phase and, for the tests, those additional capabilities weren't needed. “We're absolutely working on the evolution to 5G,” he says. If you're wondering if Nokia will be the ", " network provider on the moon, Dow says a multi-vendor environment will be flexible largely because Nokia is using a standardized technology with interoperability.", "Michael López-Alegría, chief astronaut at Axiom Space, spent time on the ", " from 2006 to 2007, and also commanded Axiom-1 in 2022—the first commercially crewed astronaut mission to the ISS. He says on the Apollo missions, the astronauts were heavily trained on geology, and while the Artemis III astronauts are undergoing similar training, having the capability to send high-definition video from the moon to more qualified people back home is changing the game.", "“Now they can show a geologist on Earth [the things they're seeing] instead of having them learn everything that a PhD knows,” López-Alegría says. “They can use it as a tool, a little bit like we do on the ISS today. I think this is a leap, and it's 50 years later, right? So it should be.”", "The IM-2 was the only scheduled test of Nokia's 4G network on the moon. It was only partly successful, but Nokia didn't share if there'd be another test now that IM-2 has concluded abruptly. Dow says the company will continue running tests on Earth ahead of Artemis III."]},

Enabling telepathic communication would, though, fit with Musk’s broader vision for Neuralink.", "Musk has long been interested in the concept of enabling telepathy with a brain-computer interface. In a ", " in which he outlined the idea behind his then new company Neuralink, Musk advocated for thought communication between people. “If I were to communicate a concept to you, you would essentially engage in consensual telepathy. You wouldn’t need to verbalize unless you want to add a little flair to the conversation or something, but the conversation would be conceptual interaction on a level that’s difficult to conceive of right now,” Musk told blogger Tim Urban at the time.", "More recently, Musk discussed Neuralink’s telepathic ambitions on the ", " in August 2024. “Entire new ways of interacting with the computer might be unlocked,” Fridman said, referring to potential improvements in the speed and accuracy of Neuralink’s device. “And with other humans,” Musk replied. “Provided they have—they want—a Neuralink too.”", "Musk has speculated that healthy people will eventually get brain implants, enabling humans to ", ".", "On the same day as the Telepathy application, Neuralink also filed to obtain trademarks for Telekinesis and Blindsight.

The conditional license was granted on the demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on antibody responses in vaccinated chickens. Previous avian influenza outbreaks prompted the US to stockpile vaccines, but those shots are based on older strains of the virus and have never been used in poultry. One of those older vaccines, made by Zoetis and conditionally approved in 2016, was first used in 2023 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors.", "Chickens already receive several vaccinations for common diseases, and some countries are already vaccinating against bird flu, but the US has held out over concerns that immunization could hurt the exported poultry market.", "“Many times vaccines are not completely effective against a viral challenge,” says Gino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry science and avian health at Penn State University. “The disease is probably not going to be fatal in many [vaccinated] animals, but the virus may still be reproducing and circulating within a population.”", "The worry therefore is that if vaccination does not provide full protection, the virus could go undetected in poultry exports. Countries that buy poultry from the US could then impose trade restrictions because of the possibility of receiving infected products. When France decided to vaccinate ducks against bird flu in October 2023, the US and Canada banned certain French poultry imports. Those bans were partially lifted in January, after the French government was able to ensure safe trade.", "In the US, poultry vaccination would likely focus on egg-laying chickens, as opposed to broiler chickens, which are raised for meat. During the current outbreak, more than 77 percent of the domestic poultry affected have been commercial egg-laying hens. In a USDA press release, Rollins said the agency is considering a “targeted and thoughtful strategy” for vaccination.", "But the broiler chicken industry worries that even targeted vaccination of laying chickens would hurt the US, which is the second-largest exporter of poultry meat. Ashley Peterson, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, says other countries are likely to ban all US poultry products, even if the US only vaccinates laying chickens. “When you move to a vaccine, you are essentially saying the virus is endemic and this is how we’re going to cope with it,” she says. “We would prefer to not cope with the virus. We would prefer to eliminate it completely.”", "The organization supports the USDA’s current policy of culling infected flocks, as well as increasing biosecurity on farms—measures such as quarantining newly acquired animals, wearing protective clothing in poultry houses, disinfecting footwear before entering animal areas, and cleaning farm equipment.", "But Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, says biosecurity alone is unlikely to eliminate bird flu. “Farmers are so fatigued from hearing about biosecurity because they’re doing everything they can already,” she says. “Without more information about how those birds are getting infected, it’s very difficult to target biosecurity correctly.”", "The virus can be carried in and out of poultry barns on shoes, clothes, and equipment that moves in and out of poultry barns. Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.", "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. “We’ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,” she says. “We have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.”", "Even if vaccination doesn’t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that’s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.", "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. “It is in everyone’s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,” he says."]},

As data streamed in from the plane’s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane’s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.", "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird’s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird’s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.", "A diagram showing the placement of covert feather layers on a bird’s wing.", "“We started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,” says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa’s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.", "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.", "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team’s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird’s wing. In Wissa’s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.", "The team’s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds’ wing movements. The late 19th century saw ", " build gliders based on bird wing shapes. Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers. It was obvious why these early pioneers were so fascinated by birds. “As a human, how do you think that you can fly if you don’t even see anything that flies,” says David Lentink, an experimental biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.", "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. “We may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don’t know how they fly,” Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.", "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow—but birds don’t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.", "Wissa’s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing’s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. “When we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,” Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.", "A wing fitted with flaps in air tunnel testing.", "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers’ natural stiffness and mass. “The idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,” Wissa says. The flaps were carefully mounted on the model aircraft with tape, ensuring the materials and their placement were just right—too much stiffness or weight would prevent the flaps from opening.", "Wissa and her colleagues then tested the flaps in specific scenarios, such as when an airplane needed to immediately land on a short runway or if it encountered sudden gusts of wind. Maintaining control when an airplane’s wing is at a high angle to the incoming air is critical—not only for stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. When Wissa and her team tested the flaps in a wind tunnel and on the prototype airplane, ", " the added flaps enhanced lift by up to 45 percent, reduced drag by nearly 31 percent, and helped prevent the sudden loss of lift that causes stalling, compared to when the aircraft was without the flaps.", "The flap-fitted model plane at the Princeton test site.", "These findings could be hugely important for the future of the aviation industry.

However, commercial testing on real aircraft didn’t begin until 2016.", "Lufthansa Technik, a German aerospace company, eventually developed ", ", an aircraft surface technology inspired by shark skin. “Today, 25 aircraft across seven airlines have been modified with our sharkskin technology, and the number is steadily growing,” says Lea Klinge, spokesperson at Lufthansa Technik. She adds that such innovations require decades of research, and that integrating new solutions into existing fleets without disrupting operations remains a major challenge.", "When considering how to scale these feather-inspired flaps, “there are some logistical challenges in terms of what kind of materials we can make those flaps out of or how we can properly attach them to the wings,” Wissa says. And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team’s experiment. “Oftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,” says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.", "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won’t think outside the box. “If you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,” he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers’ ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren’t close to immediate application. “But I don’t see it as criticism,” he says. “I see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.”", "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. “If we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we’ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,” says Sedky.", "Even if they don’t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility—there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces. These innovations could boost lift and control during such high-angle maneuvers.", "“As aircraft get smaller, they also become more susceptible to environmental factors like gusts, high winds, and turbulent airflows,” Wissa explains. Equipped with these flaps, small flying vehicles of the future might be able to handle “gusts that would have thrown an aircraft out of the sky.”"]},

She added that, “While vaccines aren’t a stand-alone solution, we will provide up to $100 million in research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, to improve their efficacy and efficiency.”", "In addition to the $100 million the USDA is spending on vaccine research, the agency is committing $500 million for biosecurity measures on farms and $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers. It’s also exploring temporary import options and considering ways to increase the domestic supply of eggs.", "Earlier this month, the USDA ", " to animal health company Zoetis for an updated bird flu vaccine for use in chickens. The conditional license was granted on the demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on antibody responses in vaccinated chickens. Previous avian influenza outbreaks prompted the US to stockpile vaccines, but those shots are based on older strains of the virus and have never been used in poultry. One of those older vaccines, made by Zoetis and conditionally approved in 2016, was first used in 2023 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors.", "Chickens already receive several vaccinations for common diseases, and some countries are already vaccinating against bird flu, but the US has held out over concerns that immunization could hurt the exported poultry market.", "“Many times vaccines are not completely effective against a viral challenge,” says Gino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry science and avian health at Penn State University. “The disease is probably not going to be fatal in many [vaccinated] animals, but the virus may still be reproducing and circulating within a population.”", "The worry therefore is that if vaccination does not provide full protection, the virus could go undetected in poultry exports. Countries that buy poultry from the US could then impose trade restrictions because of the possibility of receiving infected products. When France decided to vaccinate ducks against bird flu in October 2023, the US and Canada banned certain French poultry imports. Those bans were partially lifted in January, after the French government was able to ensure safe trade.", "In the US, poultry vaccination would likely focus on egg-laying chickens, as opposed to broiler chickens, which are raised for meat. During the current outbreak, more than 77 percent of the domestic poultry affected have been commercial egg-laying hens. In a USDA press release, Rollins said the agency is considering a “targeted and thoughtful strategy” for vaccination.", "But the broiler chicken industry worries that even targeted vaccination of laying chickens would hurt the US, which is the second-largest exporter of poultry meat. Ashley Peterson, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, says other countries are likely to ban all US poultry products, even if the US only vaccinates laying chickens. “When you move to a vaccine, you are essentially saying the virus is endemic and this is how we’re going to cope with it,” she says. “We would prefer to not cope with the virus. We would prefer to eliminate it completely.”", "The organization supports the USDA’s current policy of culling infected flocks, as well as increasing biosecurity on farms—measures such as quarantining newly acquired animals, wearing protective clothing in poultry houses, disinfecting footwear before entering animal areas, and cleaning farm equipment.", "But Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, says biosecurity alone is unlikely to eliminate bird flu. “Farmers are so fatigued from hearing about biosecurity because they’re doing everything they can already,” she says. “Without more information about how those birds are getting infected, it’s very difficult to target biosecurity correctly.”", "The virus can be carried in and out of poultry barns on shoes, clothes, and equipment that moves in and out of poultry barns. Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.", "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. “We’ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,” she says. “We have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.”", "Even if vaccination doesn’t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that’s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.", "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. “It is in everyone’s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,” he says."]},

But this wasn’t just any model aircraft. Across the top of its wings, Wissa and her team had carefully attached three rows of thin, flexible plastic flaps, hinged with tape.", "Guided by a mini flight computer once up in the air, the 1.5-meter-wide aircraft repeatedly performed a test maneuver—gradually pitching its nose up until it lost lift and became unstable, a condition known as ", ". As data streamed in from the plane’s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane’s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.", "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird’s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird’s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.", "A diagram showing the placement of covert feather layers on a bird’s wing.", "“We started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,” says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa’s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.", "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.", "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team’s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird’s wing. In Wissa’s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.", "The team’s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds’ wing movements. The late 19th century saw ", " build gliders based on bird wing shapes. Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers. It was obvious why these early pioneers were so fascinated by birds. “As a human, how do you think that you can fly if you don’t even see anything that flies,” says David Lentink, an experimental biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.", "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. “We may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don’t know how they fly,” Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.", "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow—but birds don’t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.", "Wissa’s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing’s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. “When we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,” Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.", "A wing fitted with flaps in air tunnel testing.", "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers’ natural stiffness and mass. “The idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,” Wissa says. The flaps were carefully mounted on the model aircraft with tape, ensuring the materials and their placement were just right—too much stiffness or weight would prevent the flaps from opening.", "Wissa and her colleagues then tested the flaps in specific scenarios, such as when an airplane needed to immediately land on a short runway or if it encountered sudden gusts of wind. Maintaining control when an airplane’s wing is at a high angle to the incoming air is critical—not only for stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. When Wissa and her team tested the flaps in a wind tunnel and on the prototype airplane, ", " the added flaps enhanced lift by up to 45 percent, reduced drag by nearly 31 percent, and helped prevent the sudden loss of lift that causes stalling, compared to when the aircraft was without the flaps.", "The flap-fitted model plane at the Princeton test site.", "These findings could be hugely important for the future of the aviation industry. Climate change is making weather conditions more unpredictable and severe. Over the past four decades, the frequency of extreme turbulence events ", " by ", ". To ensure passenger safety, aircraft must become more resilient and capable of performing agile maneuvers in challenging conditions without compromising aircraft stability and passenger safety.", "At the same time, air traffic volume is continuing to increase, making it crucial to explore innovations that enhance aircraft efficiency and can help decarbonize flying without having to rely solely on ", ". Passive advancements could not only help with this, but would do so without depending on complex electronic systems.", "Yet the path to getting such technology adopted commercially is challenging—and this has been the case for a lot of other animal-inspired technologies. For instance, in the 1980s, ", " that sharks have small protrusions, called riblets, covering their bodies, which reduce drag as they glide through water. They wondered if applying a similar design to aircraft could significantly cut fuel consumption. In 1997, ", " that the shark-skin-style riblets can reduce drag on airplanes by nearly 10 percent. However, commercial testing on real aircraft didn’t begin until 2016.", "Lufthansa Technik, a German aerospace company, eventually developed ", ", an aircraft surface technology inspired by shark skin. “Today, 25 aircraft across seven airlines have been modified with our sharkskin technology, and the number is steadily growing,” says Lea Klinge, spokesperson at Lufthansa Technik. She adds that such innovations require decades of research, and that integrating new solutions into existing fleets without disrupting operations remains a major challenge.", "When considering how to scale these feather-inspired flaps, “there are some logistical challenges in terms of what kind of materials we can make those flaps out of or how we can properly attach them to the wings,” Wissa says. And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team’s experiment. “Oftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,” says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.", "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won’t think outside the box. “If you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,” he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers’ ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren’t close to immediate application. “But I don’t see it as criticism,” he says. “I see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.”", "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. “If we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we’ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,” says Sedky.", "Even if they don’t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility—there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces. These innovations could boost lift and control during such high-angle maneuvers.", "“As aircraft get smaller, they also become more susceptible to environmental factors like gusts, high winds, and turbulent airflows,” Wissa explains. Equipped with these flaps, small flying vehicles of the future might be able to handle “gusts that would have thrown an aircraft out of the sky.”"]},

However, the more sensitive you make those tests, the more overdiagnosed people you will have. I read in a Cochrane review that if you screen 2,000 women, you save one life, and you over treat somewhere between 10 or 20 women. You’re always overtreating way more people than lives you’re actually saving. So the suggestion that we should do even more of these tests before we’ve perfected the ones we have does not make sense to me.", "I do multiple brain scans a week and so many of them show incidental findings. Even though I’m a neurologist and I see brain scans all the time, I don’t know what to make of half of them. We just don’t yet know how to properly interpret these scans. We need to pay more attention to detecting symptomatic disease early, rather than trying to detect asymptomatic diseases that may never progress.", "If you’re going to go for screening—and I don’t want people not to go for the suggested screenings—you do need to understand the uncertainties and realize you don’t have to panic. Of course, the minute you hear there’s some cancer cells, the panic kicks in, and you want it out and you want the maximum amount of treatment. But actually, in medicine, a lot of decisions can be made slowly. There are watchful waiting programs.", "I want to suggest to people that, before you go for the screening, know these uncertainties exist, so that you can decide before the test comes back positive what you think you’d likely want to do, and then you can take time to think about it afterwards, and you can ask for a watchful waiting program.", "I think one of the solutions would be to call these abnormal cells that we find on screening something other than “cancer.” The moment you hear that word, people’s immediate reaction is to get it out, because otherwise they think they will die of it.

Now there are more than 80.", "The discipline is advancing so rapidly that the scope of these indices is currently being debated. In some of her early research, Retamosa found that certain acoustic measurements show variations between tropical and temperate regions. One of the best known, acoustic complexity—the degree of variation and intricate structure of bioacoustic sound—has been used as a descriptor of bird diversity in temperate environments. However, in tropical areas, different investigations have shown that it does not reflect species diversity, but rather the level of acoustic activity; that is, instead of indicating the presence of multiple species, it seems to show the intense vocalization of one or a few birds.", "Careful analysis of these indices can be used to reveal the health of the forest. In ", " with Jimmy Barrantes, Retamosa outlines that measuring ", "—the variation of sound intensity across time and audio frequencies—and acoustic diversity helped them to classify the state of disturbance of some sites, while those of acoustic activity and energy did not. “You can use the indices for a first exploration of the site, to do studies over time, looking for specific changes associated with human disturbances and work with key species,” she explains.", "Every region has its own environmental concerns.

At Google’s health spinoff, Verily, her job was to bring people together to promote social health. “I first came across the term ‘social health’ during my research at Stanford, where I was developing an app around human connection,” Killam says. “Since then all my work has been through the lens of connection.”", "Ahead of her keynote speech at ", " later this month, Killam explains why social health has been the missing factor in human health.

If you think about hunger or thirst, these are different cues that our bodies give us as a helpful way to know that we’re missing something that we need. Loneliness is one of those cues. But when it’s chronic, that becomes a problem. Chronic loneliness, just like chronic stress, ultimately increases cortisol, inflammation, and weakens our immune systems. We need other people in order to survive, so chronic loneliness is literally registered as a threat. In contrast, when you have supportive relationships, that calms down your body and you’re able to manage stress more easily. Connection is a fundamental need that our bodies understand.", "The disconnection is a real crisis that gets talked a lot about.

There won't be a smartphone for astronauts to hold up to their head. “It'll be a little like driving in your car hands-free,” says Russell Ralston, the executive vice president of Extravehicular Activity at Axiom Space.

This wider analysis of sound is known as ecoacoustics—and it is exactly the work underway here in Costa Rica.", "A three-wattled bellbird (", ") in Costa Rica.", "Retamosa has been working for 20 years at the National University of Costa Rica, at the International Institute for Conservation and Wildlife Management. She uses bioacoustics and ecoacoustics to investigate the sounds of this small Central American country that hosts more than half a million species.", "“Sounds have been forgotten from a conservation point of view,” Retamosa says. “Most of the time, we hear more than we see. It’s likely that when a disturbance occurs in the system, we can detect it sooner by a sound, or lack thereof, than by other factors.”", "The development of automated recordings revolutionized bioacoustics and ecoacoustics. Now, research groups can hang sensors that record snippets of the day for months at a time without interfering with wildlife. Retamosa likes this strategy because it’s non-invasive to animals, makes it easier to have ears in large areas and hard-to-reach places, and occasionally helps discover mysterious species.", "Although she prefers to monitor ecosystems from a distance, Retamosa still has to go deep into the forest to set up recorders. Visits to the field are fascinating, but never a Sunday stroll. She has hiked miles through mud and branches, along with her colleagues Jimmy Barrantes and Randall Jiménez. They have gone up and down endless slopes. Once, she fell and fractured her ribs. But the work doesn’t end with the installation: they have to go back to change batteries and memory cards. In other countries, they use solar panels and the internet to receive real-time data; in the dark, humid rainforests of Costa Rica, it’s still done by hand.", "Acoustic-monitoring fieldwork in Costa Rica.", "That’s what Retamosa was doing when she heard the bellbird. That recording forms part of a project to track the movement and distribution of these birds, which migrate between different altitudes in the region. Their presence could be a functional indicator of the state of the AmistOsa Biological Corridor, which connects La Amistad International Park, on the border with Panama, with other reserves in southern Costa Rica.", "The biological corridor was shaped by the passage of wildlife that emerged following the 1990 Forestry Law, which protected wilderness areas and encouraged reforestation on farms through payments for environmental services. In 2010, it was officially mapped. Today it runs through indigenous territories and crosses the country’s ", ". Across the Costa Rica there are now 53 corridors, covering 38 percent of its territory.", "The project data will help the committee in charge of Costa Rica’s biodiversity and natural resources make decisions. “The idea is to make a monitoring protocol, linking the government, the communities, and us as academia, providing support for analysis and interpretation,” Retamosa says.", "A Limón giant glass frog in the rain in Braulio Carillo National Park in Costa Rica.", "Recorders hung in the wild capture many terabytes of data, so listening to every recording is not feasible. With an eye toward making it a cost-efficient strategy, researchers have developed acoustic indices: mathematical formulas that interpret ecosystem traits from the recorded sounds. “They can reflect the acoustic energy of a place, activity, or frequency diversity,” Retamosa explains. When she started in this field, there were only eight acoustic indices. Now there are more than 80.", "The discipline is advancing so rapidly that the scope of these indices is currently being debated. In some of her early research, Retamosa found that certain acoustic measurements show variations between tropical and temperate regions. One of the best known, acoustic complexity—the degree of variation and intricate structure of bioacoustic sound—has been used as a descriptor of bird diversity in temperate environments. However, in tropical areas, different investigations have shown that it does not reflect species diversity, but rather the level of acoustic activity; that is, instead of indicating the presence of multiple species, it seems to show the intense vocalization of one or a few birds.", "Careful analysis of these indices can be used to reveal the health of the forest. In ", " with Jimmy Barrantes, Retamosa outlines that measuring ", "—the variation of sound intensity across time and audio frequencies—and acoustic diversity helped them to classify the state of disturbance of some sites, while those of acoustic activity and energy did not. “You can use the indices for a first exploration of the site, to do studies over time, looking for specific changes associated with human disturbances and work with key species,” she explains.", "Every region has its own environmental concerns. In Costa Rica, tourism has grown dramatically: between 1984 and 1989, international arrivals ", " 37 percent, from 273,900 to 375,900 visitors. But since 1990, the pace has skyrocketed: last year the country ", " 2.6 million tourists.", "This boom poses sustainability challenges. To address them, the International Institute for Conservation and Wildlife Management team analyzes sounds inside and outside protected areas. One of its tools is an index that measures the ratio between biological sounds and human-made noises.", "The acoustic quality of the landscape must be monitored to conserve the country’s ecotourism.", "In recent years, automated acoustic detection, using artificial intelligence and machine learning, has revolutionized species identification. Previously, advanced programming skills were required to use AI, but with the advent of accessible interface models, it’s becoming more popular. Exoacoustics is increasingly focused on developing more accurate models for classifying sounds.", "And it’s becoming possible to pick out individual species in the soundscape using these tools. In a study of farms conducted as part of the Bosque Vivo project, run by Costa Rica’s National Forest Financing Fund, the research team found that ", ", a bird species sensitive to landscape disturbance, was only present in the control sites of Corcovado National Park and in the forests of the best-conserved farms.", "In Guanacaste, Retamosa is also working on a long-term monitoring protocol to evaluate how ecosystems and biodiversity are responding to climate variability. In other countries, similar projects are recording sound baselines in sites with minimal human intervention that, in the future, could be compared with up-to-date recordings to detect changes. Although storing all these records is costly, Retamosa believes that they’ll form an invaluable historical archive, which one day can be returned to when technology allows further analysis.", " ", " "]},

Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.", "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. “We’ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,” she says. “We have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.”", "Even if vaccination doesn’t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that’s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.", "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. “It is in everyone’s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,” he says."]},

As data streamed in from the plane’s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane’s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.", "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird’s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird’s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.", "A diagram showing the placement of covert feather layers on a bird’s wing.", "“We started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,” says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa’s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.", "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.", "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team’s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird’s wing. In Wissa’s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.", "The team’s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds’ wing movements. The late 19th century saw ", " build gliders based on bird wing shapes. Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers. It was obvious why these early pioneers were so fascinated by birds. “As a human, how do you think that you can fly if you don’t even see anything that flies,” says David Lentink, an experimental biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.", "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. “We may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don’t know how they fly,” Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.", "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow—but birds don’t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.", "Wissa’s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing’s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. “When we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,” Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.", "A wing fitted with flaps in air tunnel testing.", "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers’ natural stiffness and mass. “The idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,” Wissa says. The flaps were carefully mounted on the model aircraft with tape, ensuring the materials and their placement were just right—too much stiffness or weight would prevent the flaps from opening.", "Wissa and her colleagues then tested the flaps in specific scenarios, such as when an airplane needed to immediately land on a short runway or if it encountered sudden gusts of wind. Maintaining control when an airplane’s wing is at a high angle to the incoming air is critical—not only for stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. When Wissa and her team tested the flaps in a wind tunnel and on the prototype airplane, ", " the added flaps enhanced lift by up to 45 percent, reduced drag by nearly 31 percent, and helped prevent the sudden loss of lift that causes stalling, compared to when the aircraft was without the flaps.", "The flap-fitted model plane at the Princeton test site.", "These findings could be hugely important for the future of the aviation industry.

To ensure passenger safety, aircraft must become more resilient and capable of performing agile maneuvers in challenging conditions without compromising aircraft stability and passenger safety.", "At the same time, air traffic volume is continuing to increase, making it crucial to explore innovations that enhance aircraft efficiency and can help decarbonize flying without having to rely solely on ", ". Passive advancements could not only help with this, but would do so without depending on complex electronic systems.", "Yet the path to getting such technology adopted commercially is challenging—and this has been the case for a lot of other animal-inspired technologies. For instance, in the 1980s, ", " that sharks have small protrusions, called riblets, covering their bodies, which reduce drag as they glide through water. They wondered if applying a similar design to aircraft could significantly cut fuel consumption. In 1997, ", " that the shark-skin-style riblets can reduce drag on airplanes by nearly 10 percent. However, commercial testing on real aircraft didn’t begin until 2016.", "Lufthansa Technik, a German aerospace company, eventually developed ", ", an aircraft surface technology inspired by shark skin. “Today, 25 aircraft across seven airlines have been modified with our sharkskin technology, and the number is steadily growing,” says Lea Klinge, spokesperson at Lufthansa Technik. She adds that such innovations require decades of research, and that integrating new solutions into existing fleets without disrupting operations remains a major challenge.", "When considering how to scale these feather-inspired flaps, “there are some logistical challenges in terms of what kind of materials we can make those flaps out of or how we can properly attach them to the wings,” Wissa says. And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team’s experiment. “Oftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,” says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.", "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won’t think outside the box. “If you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,” he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers’ ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren’t close to immediate application. “But I don’t see it as criticism,” he says. “I see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.”", "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. “If we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we’ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,” says Sedky.", "Even if they don’t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility—there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces. These innovations could boost lift and control during such high-angle maneuvers.", "“As aircraft get smaller, they also become more susceptible to environmental factors like gusts, high winds, and turbulent airflows,” Wissa explains. Equipped with these flaps, small flying vehicles of the future might be able to handle “gusts that would have thrown an aircraft out of the sky.”"]},

However, the more sensitive you make those tests, the more overdiagnosed people you will have. I read in a Cochrane review that if you screen 2,000 women, you save one life, and you over treat somewhere between 10 or 20 women.

The company announced on March 7 that the mission quickly concluded.

In an interview at ", ", John Dow told WIRED this box is comprised of the radio, base station, routing, and core, all integrated into a compact system. He's the general manager of Nokia Bell Labs' Space Communications Systems.", "Nokia says it successfully powered up the NIB, which received commands and transmitted data to Intuitive Machines' ground station on Earth. All system components were fully functional, though it was online for only about 25 minutes until the power went out. The company had planned to make the first cellular call on the moon with the rovers, but the vehicles weren't deployed.", "What was supposed to happen? A few hours after landing, and after system checks, Athena's garage door would've opened and its onboard vehicles released. After traversing on the lunar surface, the rovers would have extended their antennas and connected to the network. “Think of it like a connected vehicle,\" Dow says. \"It has user equipment that we built that will connect with a 4G link to the network in a box on Athena.”", "One of these vehicles was the ", ", nicknamed Grace, from Intuitive Machines—it was designed to hop into a permanently shadowed moon crater to take pictures and readings, looking for potential signs of water ice.", "Any data collected would have been transferred back to the NIB on Athena, which would have transferred it to Earth via a long-haul satellite uplink. (That trip to Earth takes about a second and a half.) Dow says the rovers were supposed to travel under 2 kilometers away from Athena (around 1.2 miles), which is how far the broadband connectivity will be supported. If Lunar Outpost mission controllers in Colorado were to send commands to the rovers, the data would have traveled via Intuitive Machine's direct-to-Earth data transmission service to Athena and dispersed through the 4G network.", "While the 4G LTE flavor is the same as on Earth, Nokia's Lunar Surface Communications System was optimized for space travel, with several redundancies to recover from potential hardware or electronic failures (lack of power was not one of them). Nokia's components were replaced with lighter materials when possible. For example, the company says it replaced a heavy cavity filter with a ceramic-based solution, reducing its weight by five times. Nokia also says it designed a thermal management solution that handles “excess heat through conduction and radiation” since it can't use atmosphere-dependent convection used in electronics on Earth.", "This 4G NIB had a shorter than planned shelf life, but even if the mission had been successful, the NIB would still be short-lived. Dow says it wasn't meant to survive the harsh lunar night, which starts in about 9 days (a lunar day and a lunar night are each the equivalent of around 14 Earth days). In fact, the entire IM-2 mission was planned to end at this time, as the equipment's solar cells wouldn't have the energy to power the devices. For the Artemis III mission, the network and modules in the spacesuits will be built to survive the extreme temperatures of the moon, which can get as hot as 250 degrees Fahrenheit or as cold as -208 degrees.", "Over time, the goal is to establish ", ". “Once you have robust connectivity, you can see how you can have a basic infrastructure to support all the visions people talk about,\" Dow says. \"As you see the scaling of travel to the lunar surface, then you'll have inhabitants,\" Dow says. “Ultimately, it will get to the point where you no longer have to bring the network with you, you just have to bring the device because the network's there.”", "The 4G LTE communications that will be integrated into the Axiom spacesuit in the future will be able to communicate from astronaut to lander and astronaut to lander to astronaut. There won't be a smartphone for astronauts to hold up to their head. “It'll be a little like driving in your car hands-free,” says Russell Ralston, the executive vice president of Extravehicular Activity at Axiom Space. The microphones in the suit will be voice activated, and the network will be able to handle multiple real-time HD video streams, not to mention telemetry and data from the built-in sensors.", "So why not 5G? The current generation mobile network ", " over its predecessor, after all. Dow says development for space takes a long time and that Nokia wanted to start with technology that has been robustly tested. At the time, 5G was still in its early adoption phase and, for the tests, those additional capabilities weren't needed. “We're absolutely working on the evolution to 5G,” he says. If you're wondering if Nokia will be the ", " network provider on the moon, Dow says a multi-vendor environment will be flexible largely because Nokia is using a standardized technology with interoperability.", "Michael López-Alegría, chief astronaut at Axiom Space, spent time on the ", " from 2006 to 2007, and also commanded Axiom-1 in 2022—the first commercially crewed astronaut mission to the ISS. He says on the Apollo missions, the astronauts were heavily trained on geology, and while the Artemis III astronauts are undergoing similar training, having the capability to send high-definition video from the moon to more qualified people back home is changing the game.", "“Now they can show a geologist on Earth [the things they're seeing] instead of having them learn everything that a PhD knows,” López-Alegría says. “They can use it as a tool, a little bit like we do on the ISS today. I think this is a leap, and it's 50 years later, right? So it should be.”", "The IM-2 was the only scheduled test of Nokia's 4G network on the moon. It was only partly successful, but Nokia didn't share if there'd be another test now that IM-2 has concluded abruptly.

As data streamed in from the plane’s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane’s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.", "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird’s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird’s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.", "A diagram showing the placement of covert feather layers on a bird’s wing.", "“We started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,” says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa’s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.", "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.", "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team’s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird’s wing. In Wissa’s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.", "The team’s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds’ wing movements. The late 19th century saw ", " build gliders based on bird wing shapes. Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers. It was obvious why these early pioneers were so fascinated by birds. “As a human, how do you think that you can fly if you don’t even see anything that flies,” says David Lentink, an experimental biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.", "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. “We may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don’t know how they fly,” Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.", "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow—but birds don’t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.", "Wissa’s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing’s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. “When we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,” Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.", "A wing fitted with flaps in air tunnel testing.", "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers’ natural stiffness and mass. “The idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,” Wissa says. The flaps were carefully mounted on the model aircraft with tape, ensuring the materials and their placement were just right—too much stiffness or weight would prevent the flaps from opening.", "Wissa and her colleagues then tested the flaps in specific scenarios, such as when an airplane needed to immediately land on a short runway or if it encountered sudden gusts of wind. Maintaining control when an airplane’s wing is at a high angle to the incoming air is critical—not only for stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. When Wissa and her team tested the flaps in a wind tunnel and on the prototype airplane, ", " the added flaps enhanced lift by up to 45 percent, reduced drag by nearly 31 percent, and helped prevent the sudden loss of lift that causes stalling, compared to when the aircraft was without the flaps.", "The flap-fitted model plane at the Princeton test site.", "These findings could be hugely important for the future of the aviation industry.

She adds that such innovations require decades of research, and that integrating new solutions into existing fleets without disrupting operations remains a major challenge.", "When considering how to scale these feather-inspired flaps, “there are some logistical challenges in terms of what kind of materials we can make those flaps out of or how we can properly attach them to the wings,” Wissa says. And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team’s experiment. “Oftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,” says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.", "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won’t think outside the box. “If you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,” he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers’ ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren’t close to immediate application. “But I don’t see it as criticism,” he says. “I see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.”", "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. “If we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we’ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,” says Sedky.", "Even if they don’t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility—there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces. These innovations could boost lift and control during such high-angle maneuvers.", "“As aircraft get smaller, they also become more susceptible to environmental factors like gusts, high winds, and turbulent airflows,” Wissa explains. Equipped with these flaps, small flying vehicles of the future might be able to handle “gusts that would have thrown an aircraft out of the sky.”"]},

Many people voiced their disappointment on social media and pushed the government to take action to clean up the air. It became “an environmental awakening akin to the London Fog,” says the former US diplomat. In a twist that’s almost incomprehensible today, the Chinese government even officially adopted the US State Department’s method for reporting air quality. It also made significant efforts to clean up air pollution, and collaborated with the EPA on climate and environmental issues.", "The DOSAir program was welcomed in many other countries as well, especially those that didn’t have an existing infrastructure to collect air quality data, says Westervelt. In some cases, local governments used the high-quality data collected at US embassies to calibrate readings on their own lower-cost air monitors.", "For these countries, ending support for the air quality monitoring program could hinder their progress cleaning up the air, says Westervelt. “You can’t really mitigate the air pollution problem unless you have quantitative evidence,” he explains. “Losing it is a pretty big blow.”", "Over the past month, the Trump administration has slashed funding and staff across the federal government as part of a ", " led by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But the air quality monitoring program isn’t very expensive for the US State Department to maintain. Westervelt estimates it costs just tens of thousands of dollars a year because most of the monitoring equipment has already been purchased, and the main expenses are associated with maintenance.", "The program demonstrated how relatively low-cost information technologies could be used to spur substantial reductions of air pollution, says Akshaya Jha, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who co-authored the 2022 study. When a US embassy began publishing the readings in a city, he says, it often raised public awareness about pollution and put pressure on the host country to take action to clean up the air. Jha found that local Google searches for the term “air quality” steadily increased after monitors were installed. Air pollution levels, estimated by satellite measurements, also dropped.", "In the long run, Jha’s research also found that the program actually saves money for the State Department, which is required to pay diplomats extra compensation for living in more hazardous environments. “Our estimates indicate that the monitors save the median embassy roughly $34,000 a year in this kind of hardship payments,” Jha says.", "Even beyond the hardship compensation, creating a world where fewer people are dying from diseases linked to air pollution would reduce the need for things like costly medical treatments. “In terms of benefits of this program relative to its costs, It’s a clear winner,” Jha says."]},

One of the best known, acoustic complexity—the degree of variation and intricate structure of bioacoustic sound—has been used as a descriptor of bird diversity in temperate environments. However, in tropical areas, different investigations have shown that it does not reflect species diversity, but rather the level of acoustic activity; that is, instead of indicating the presence of multiple species, it seems to show the intense vocalization of one or a few birds.", "Careful analysis of these indices can be used to reveal the health of the forest.

Everything will freeze and get buried in snow. And some other country will likely immediately take over.", "Others share this fear of a station takeover. “Even if science funding is cut back, there is an urgent need for the US to invest in icebreakers and polar airlift capability otherwise at some point the US-managed South Pole station might not be serviceable,” says Klaus Dodds, an Antarctic expert and professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway University of London.", "Experts are concerned that countries like Russia and China—who have already been eagle-eyed on continental influence—will quickly jostle to fill the power vacuum. “Presumably it would be humiliating for anyone who wishes to promote ‘America First’ to witness China offer to take over the occupation and management of the base at the heart of Antarctica. China is a very determined polar power,” says Dodds.", "The political outcome of the US pulling back from its Antarctic research and presence could be dire, sources tell WIRED.", "Antarctica isn’t owned by any one country.

The US, traditionally, has played a key role in championing the treaty: “Many of the leading polar scientists and social scientists are either US citizens and/or have been enriched by contact with US-led programs,” says Dodds.", "That leadership role could change quickly. The US also participates in a number of international collaborations involving major Antarctic scientific projects. A US pullback, Whitehorn says, “makes it very hard to regard the US as a reliable partner, so I think there will be a lot less interest in accepting US leadership in such things … The uncertainty will drive people away and sacrifice the leadership the US already has.”", "“If the NSF can’t function, or we don’t fund it, projects with long lead times can just die,” another scientist says. “I’m sure international partners would be happy to partner elsewhere.

The virus has been detected in wild birds in every state, which go on to expose commercial poultry and other animals. At least ", " and ", " have been affected in the current US outbreak. Infected animals have led to 70 cases of bird flu in people, ", ".", "Bird flu is extremely deadly for poultry and can wipe out flocks quickly. To stop the virus from spreading, the USDA has long promoted culling infected birds. The practice has led to a 53 percent increase in egg prices from January 2024 to January of this year, and ", " an additional 40 percent increase in 2025.", "In a ", " published Wednesday morning, Rollins said the USDA is “exploring the use of vaccines and therapeutics for laying chickens,” which should help reduce the need to depopulate flocks. She added that, “While vaccines aren’t a stand-alone solution, we will provide up to $100 million in research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, to improve their efficacy and efficiency.”", "In addition to the $100 million the USDA is spending on vaccine research, the agency is committing $500 million for biosecurity measures on farms and $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers. It’s also exploring temporary import options and considering ways to increase the domestic supply of eggs.", "Earlier this month, the USDA ", " to animal health company Zoetis for an updated bird flu vaccine for use in chickens. The conditional license was granted on the demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on antibody responses in vaccinated chickens. Previous avian influenza outbreaks prompted the US to stockpile vaccines, but those shots are based on older strains of the virus and have never been used in poultry. One of those older vaccines, made by Zoetis and conditionally approved in 2016, was first used in 2023 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors.", "Chickens already receive several vaccinations for common diseases, and some countries are already vaccinating against bird flu, but the US has held out over concerns that immunization could hurt the exported poultry market.", "“Many times vaccines are not completely effective against a viral challenge,” says Gino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry science and avian health at Penn State University. “The disease is probably not going to be fatal in many [vaccinated] animals, but the virus may still be reproducing and circulating within a population.”", "The worry therefore is that if vaccination does not provide full protection, the virus could go undetected in poultry exports. Countries that buy poultry from the US could then impose trade restrictions because of the possibility of receiving infected products. When France decided to vaccinate ducks against bird flu in October 2023, the US and Canada banned certain French poultry imports. Those bans were partially lifted in January, after the French government was able to ensure safe trade.", "In the US, poultry vaccination would likely focus on egg-laying chickens, as opposed to broiler chickens, which are raised for meat. During the current outbreak, more than 77 percent of the domestic poultry affected have been commercial egg-laying hens. In a USDA press release, Rollins said the agency is considering a “targeted and thoughtful strategy” for vaccination.", "But the broiler chicken industry worries that even targeted vaccination of laying chickens would hurt the US, which is the second-largest exporter of poultry meat. Ashley Peterson, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, says other countries are likely to ban all US poultry products, even if the US only vaccinates laying chickens. “When you move to a vaccine, you are essentially saying the virus is endemic and this is how we’re going to cope with it,” she says. “We would prefer to not cope with the virus. We would prefer to eliminate it completely.”", "The organization supports the USDA’s current policy of culling infected flocks, as well as increasing biosecurity on farms—measures such as quarantining newly acquired animals, wearing protective clothing in poultry houses, disinfecting footwear before entering animal areas, and cleaning farm equipment.", "But Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, says biosecurity alone is unlikely to eliminate bird flu. “Farmers are so fatigued from hearing about biosecurity because they’re doing everything they can already,” she says. “Without more information about how those birds are getting infected, it’s very difficult to target biosecurity correctly.”", "The virus can be carried in and out of poultry barns on shoes, clothes, and equipment that moves in and out of poultry barns. Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.", "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. “We’ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,” she says. “We have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.”", "Even if vaccination doesn’t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that’s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.", "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. “It is in everyone’s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,” he says."]},

As data streamed in from the plane’s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane’s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.", "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird’s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird’s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.", "A diagram showing the placement of covert feather layers on a bird’s wing.", "“We started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,” says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa’s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.", "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.", "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team’s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird’s wing. In Wissa’s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.", "The team’s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds’ wing movements. The late 19th century saw ", " build gliders based on bird wing shapes. Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers. It was obvious why these early pioneers were so fascinated by birds. “As a human, how do you think that you can fly if you don’t even see anything that flies,” says David Lentink, an experimental biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.", "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. “We may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don’t know how they fly,” Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.", "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow—but birds don’t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.", "Wissa’s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing’s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. “When we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,” Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.", "A wing fitted with flaps in air tunnel testing.", "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers’ natural stiffness and mass. “The idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,” Wissa says. The flaps were carefully mounted on the model aircraft with tape, ensuring the materials and their placement were just right—too much stiffness or weight would prevent the flaps from opening.", "Wissa and her colleagues then tested the flaps in specific scenarios, such as when an airplane needed to immediately land on a short runway or if it encountered sudden gusts of wind. Maintaining control when an airplane’s wing is at a high angle to the incoming air is critical—not only for stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. When Wissa and her team tested the flaps in a wind tunnel and on the prototype airplane, ", " the added flaps enhanced lift by up to 45 percent, reduced drag by nearly 31 percent, and helped prevent the sudden loss of lift that causes stalling, compared to when the aircraft was without the flaps.", "The flap-fitted model plane at the Princeton test site.", "These findings could be hugely important for the future of the aviation industry.

To ensure passenger safety, aircraft must become more resilient and capable of performing agile maneuvers in challenging conditions without compromising aircraft stability and passenger safety.", "At the same time, air traffic volume is continuing to increase, making it crucial to explore innovations that enhance aircraft efficiency and can help decarbonize flying without having to rely solely on ", ". Passive advancements could not only help with this, but would do so without depending on complex electronic systems.", "Yet the path to getting such technology adopted commercially is challenging—and this has been the case for a lot of other animal-inspired technologies.

She adds that such innovations require decades of research, and that integrating new solutions into existing fleets without disrupting operations remains a major challenge.", "When considering how to scale these feather-inspired flaps, “there are some logistical challenges in terms of what kind of materials we can make those flaps out of or how we can properly attach them to the wings,” Wissa says. And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team’s experiment. “Oftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,” says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.", "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won’t think outside the box. “If you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,” he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers’ ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren’t close to immediate application. “But I don’t see it as criticism,” he says. “I see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.”", "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. “If we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we’ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,” says Sedky.", "Even if they don’t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility—there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces.

However, the more sensitive you make those tests, the more overdiagnosed people you will have. I read in a Cochrane review that if you screen 2,000 women, you save one life, and you over treat somewhere between 10 or 20 women.

Workers present at the station aren’t able to physically leave until October, and a midseason firing, or loss of funding, would present a unique set of challenges.", "Sources are also bracing for at least a ", " due to DOGE cuts. These cuts are sending Antarctic scientists with assistants and graduate students scrambling. “We didn’t know if we could pay graduate students,” says one scientist. While research is conducted on the continent, scientists bring their findings back to the US to process and analyze. A lot of the funding also operates the science itself: For one project that requires electricity to run detectors, the scientist “was paranoid we would not be able to literally pay bills for an experiment starved for data.” That hasn’t come to fruition yet, but as funding cycles restart in the coming weeks and months, scientists are on tenterhooks.", "Sources tell WIRED that Germany, Canada, Spain, and China have already started taking advantage of that uncertainty by recruiting US scientists focused on Antarctica.", "“Foreign countries are actively recruiting my colleagues, and some have already left,” says one Antarctic scientist. “My students are looking at jobs overseas now … people have been coming [to the US] to do science my whole life. Now people are going the other way.”", "“Now is a great time to see if anyone wants to jump ship,” another Antarctic scientist says. “I do worry about a brain drain of tenured academics, or students who are shunted out.”", "“The damage caused by gutting the [Antarctic] science budget like this is going to last generations,” says another.", "Throughout DOGE’s cuts to the federal government, representatives have said that if something needs to be brought back, it could be.

Everything will freeze and get buried in snow. And some other country will likely immediately take over.", "Others share this fear of a station takeover. “Even if science funding is cut back, there is an urgent need for the US to invest in icebreakers and polar airlift capability otherwise at some point the US-managed South Pole station might not be serviceable,” says Klaus Dodds, an Antarctic expert and professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway University of London.", "Experts are concerned that countries like Russia and China—who have already been eagle-eyed on continental influence—will quickly jostle to fill the power vacuum. “Presumably it would be humiliating for anyone who wishes to promote ‘America First’ to witness China offer to take over the occupation and management of the base at the heart of Antarctica. China is a very determined polar power,” says Dodds.", "The political outcome of the US pulling back from its Antarctic research and presence could be dire, sources tell WIRED.", "Antarctica isn’t owned by any one country. Instead it’s governed by the ", ", which protects Antarctica and the scientific research taking place on the continent, and forbids mining and nuclear activity. Some countries, including China and Russia, have ", " that they would be interested in ", ", particularly around resource ", " and fishing restrictions. The US, traditionally, has played a key role in championing the treaty: “Many of the leading polar scientists and social scientists are either US citizens and/or have been enriched by contact with US-led programs,” says Dodds.", "That leadership role could change quickly. The US also participates in a number of international collaborations involving major Antarctic scientific projects. A US pullback, Whitehorn says, “makes it very hard to regard the US as a reliable partner, so I think there will be a lot less interest in accepting US leadership in such things … The uncertainty will drive people away and sacrifice the leadership the US already has.”", "“If the NSF can’t function, or we don’t fund it, projects with long lead times can just die,” another scientist says. “I’m sure international partners would be happy to partner elsewhere.

She added that, “While vaccines aren’t a stand-alone solution, we will provide up to $100 million in research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, to improve their efficacy and efficiency.”", "In addition to the $100 million the USDA is spending on vaccine research, the agency is committing $500 million for biosecurity measures on farms and $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers.

The conditional license was granted on the demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on antibody responses in vaccinated chickens. Previous avian influenza outbreaks prompted the US to stockpile vaccines, but those shots are based on older strains of the virus and have never been used in poultry. One of those older vaccines, made by Zoetis and conditionally approved in 2016, was first used in 2023 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors.", "Chickens already receive several vaccinations for common diseases, and some countries are already vaccinating against bird flu, but the US has held out over concerns that immunization could hurt the exported poultry market.", "“Many times vaccines are not completely effective against a viral challenge,” says Gino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry science and avian health at Penn State University. “The disease is probably not going to be fatal in many [vaccinated] animals, but the virus may still be reproducing and circulating within a population.”", "The worry therefore is that if vaccination does not provide full protection, the virus could go undetected in poultry exports. Countries that buy poultry from the US could then impose trade restrictions because of the possibility of receiving infected products. When France decided to vaccinate ducks against bird flu in October 2023, the US and Canada banned certain French poultry imports. Those bans were partially lifted in January, after the French government was able to ensure safe trade.", "In the US, poultry vaccination would likely focus on egg-laying chickens, as opposed to broiler chickens, which are raised for meat. During the current outbreak, more than 77 percent of the domestic poultry affected have been commercial egg-laying hens. In a USDA press release, Rollins said the agency is considering a “targeted and thoughtful strategy” for vaccination.", "But the broiler chicken industry worries that even targeted vaccination of laying chickens would hurt the US, which is the second-largest exporter of poultry meat. Ashley Peterson, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, says other countries are likely to ban all US poultry products, even if the US only vaccinates laying chickens. “When you move to a vaccine, you are essentially saying the virus is endemic and this is how we’re going to cope with it,” she says. “We would prefer to not cope with the virus. We would prefer to eliminate it completely.”", "The organization supports the USDA’s current policy of culling infected flocks, as well as increasing biosecurity on farms—measures such as quarantining newly acquired animals, wearing protective clothing in poultry houses, disinfecting footwear before entering animal areas, and cleaning farm equipment.", "But Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, says biosecurity alone is unlikely to eliminate bird flu. “Farmers are so fatigued from hearing about biosecurity because they’re doing everything they can already,” she says. “Without more information about how those birds are getting infected, it’s very difficult to target biosecurity correctly.”", "The virus can be carried in and out of poultry barns on shoes, clothes, and equipment that moves in and out of poultry barns. Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.", "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. “We’ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,” she says. “We have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.”", "Even if vaccination doesn’t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that’s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.", "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. “It is in everyone’s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,” he says."]},

Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.", "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. “We’ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,” she says. “We have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.”", "Even if vaccination doesn’t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that’s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.", "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. “It is in everyone’s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,” he says."]},

Across the top of its wings, Wissa and her team had carefully attached three rows of thin, flexible plastic flaps, hinged with tape.", "Guided by a mini flight computer once up in the air, the 1.5-meter-wide aircraft repeatedly performed a test maneuver—gradually pitching its nose up until it lost lift and became unstable, a condition known as ", ". As data streamed in from the plane’s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane’s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.", "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird’s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird’s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.", "A diagram showing the placement of covert feather layers on a bird’s wing.", "“We started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,” says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa’s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.", "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.", "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team’s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird’s wing. In Wissa’s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.", "The team’s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds’ wing movements. The late 19th century saw ", " build gliders based on bird wing shapes. Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers. It was obvious why these early pioneers were so fascinated by birds. “As a human, how do you think that you can fly if you don’t even see anything that flies,” says David Lentink, an experimental biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.", "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. “We may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don’t know how they fly,” Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.", "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow—but birds don’t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.", "Wissa’s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing’s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. “When we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,” Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.", "A wing fitted with flaps in air tunnel testing.", "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers’ natural stiffness and mass. “The idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,” Wissa says.

And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team’s experiment. “Oftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,” says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.", "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won’t think outside the box. “If you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,” he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers’ ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren’t close to immediate application. “But I don’t see it as criticism,” he says. “I see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.”", "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. “If we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we’ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,” says Sedky.", "Even if they don’t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility—there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces. These innovations could boost lift and control during such high-angle maneuvers.", "“As aircraft get smaller, they also become more susceptible to environmental factors like gusts, high winds, and turbulent airflows,” Wissa explains. Equipped with these flaps, small flying vehicles of the future might be able to handle “gusts that would have thrown an aircraft out of the sky.”"]},

In an interview at ", ", John Dow told WIRED this box is comprised of the radio, base station, routing, and core, all integrated into a compact system. He's the general manager of Nokia Bell Labs' Space Communications Systems.", "Nokia says it successfully powered up the NIB, which received commands and transmitted data to Intuitive Machines' ground station on Earth. All system components were fully functional, though it was online for only about 25 minutes until the power went out. The company had planned to make the first cellular call on the moon with the rovers, but the vehicles weren't deployed.", "What was supposed to happen? A few hours after landing, and after system checks, Athena's garage door would've opened and its onboard vehicles released. After traversing on the lunar surface, the rovers would have extended their antennas and connected to the network. “Think of it like a connected vehicle,\" Dow says. \"It has user equipment that we built that will connect with a 4G link to the network in a box on Athena.”", "One of these vehicles was the ", ", nicknamed Grace, from Intuitive Machines—it was designed to hop into a permanently shadowed moon crater to take pictures and readings, looking for potential signs of water ice.", "Any data collected would have been transferred back to the NIB on Athena, which would have transferred it to Earth via a long-haul satellite uplink. (That trip to Earth takes about a second and a half.) Dow says the rovers were supposed to travel under 2 kilometers away from Athena (around 1.2 miles), which is how far the broadband connectivity will be supported. If Lunar Outpost mission controllers in Colorado were to send commands to the rovers, the data would have traveled via Intuitive Machine's direct-to-Earth data transmission service to Athena and dispersed through the 4G network.", "While the 4G LTE flavor is the same as on Earth, Nokia's Lunar Surface Communications System was optimized for space travel, with several redundancies to recover from potential hardware or electronic failures (lack of power was not one of them). Nokia's components were replaced with lighter materials when possible. For example, the company says it replaced a heavy cavity filter with a ceramic-based solution, reducing its weight by five times. Nokia also says it designed a thermal management solution that handles “excess heat through conduction and radiation” since it can't use atmosphere-dependent convection used in electronics on Earth.", "This 4G NIB had a shorter than planned shelf life, but even if the mission had been successful, the NIB would still be short-lived. Dow says it wasn't meant to survive the harsh lunar night, which starts in about 9 days (a lunar day and a lunar night are each the equivalent of around 14 Earth days). In fact, the entire IM-2 mission was planned to end at this time, as the equipment's solar cells wouldn't have the energy to power the devices. For the Artemis III mission, the network and modules in the spacesuits will be built to survive the extreme temperatures of the moon, which can get as hot as 250 degrees Fahrenheit or as cold as -208 degrees.", "Over time, the goal is to establish ", ". “Once you have robust connectivity, you can see how you can have a basic infrastructure to support all the visions people talk about,\" Dow says. \"As you see the scaling of travel to the lunar surface, then you'll have inhabitants,\" Dow says. “Ultimately, it will get to the point where you no longer have to bring the network with you, you just have to bring the device because the network's there.”", "The 4G LTE communications that will be integrated into the Axiom spacesuit in the future will be able to communicate from astronaut to lander and astronaut to lander to astronaut. There won't be a smartphone for astronauts to hold up to their head. “It'll be a little like driving in your car hands-free,” says Russell Ralston, the executive vice president of Extravehicular Activity at Axiom Space.

Now there are more than 80.", "The discipline is advancing so rapidly that the scope of these indices is currently being debated. In some of her early research, Retamosa found that certain acoustic measurements show variations between tropical and temperate regions. One of the best known, acoustic complexity—the degree of variation and intricate structure of bioacoustic sound—has been used as a descriptor of bird diversity in temperate environments. However, in tropical areas, different investigations have shown that it does not reflect species diversity, but rather the level of acoustic activity; that is, instead of indicating the presence of multiple species, it seems to show the intense vocalization of one or a few birds.", "Careful analysis of these indices can be used to reveal the health of the forest.
