Experts think such stars appear by being \u201ccatapulted outward\u201d by a supermassive gravitational structure under the Hills mechanism\u2014which is where a binary star system interacts with a black hole, with one star captured by the black hole and the other flung away from it.",

                "The US has dealt with flare-ups of bird flu in the past, but the current outbreak has been raging since 2022. The virus has been detected in wild birds in every state, which go on to expose commercial poultry and other animals. At least ",

                "Bird flu is extremely deadly for poultry and can wipe out flocks quickly. To stop the virus from spreading, the USDA has long promoted culling infected birds. The practice has led to a 53 percent increase in egg prices from January 2024 to January of this year, and ",
                " an additional 40 percent increase in 2025.",
                "In a ",
                " published Wednesday morning, Rollins said the USDA is \u201cexploring the use of vaccines and therapeutics for laying chickens,\u201d which should help reduce the need to depopulate flocks. She added that, \u201cWhile vaccines aren\u2019t a stand-alone solution, we will provide up to $100 million in research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, to improve their efficacy and efficiency.\u201d",
                "In addition to the $100 million the USDA is spending on vaccine research, the agency is committing $500 million for biosecurity measures on farms and $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers. It\u2019s also exploring temporary import options and considering ways to increase the domestic supply of eggs.",
                "Earlier this month, the USDA ",
                " to animal health company Zoetis for an updated bird flu vaccine for use in chickens. The conditional license was granted on the demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on antibody responses in vaccinated chickens. Previous avian influenza outbreaks prompted the US to stockpile vaccines, but those shots are based on older strains of the virus and have never been used in poultry. One of those older vaccines, made by Zoetis and conditionally approved in 2016, was first used in 2023 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors.",
                "Chickens already receive several vaccinations for common diseases, and some countries are already vaccinating against bird flu, but the US has held out over concerns that immunization could hurt the exported poultry market.",
                "\u201cMany times vaccines are not completely effective against a viral challenge,\u201d says Gino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry science and avian health at Penn State University. \u201cThe disease is probably not going to be fatal in many [vaccinated] animals, but the virus may still be reproducing and circulating within a population.\u201d",
                "The worry therefore is that if vaccination does not provide full protection, the virus could go undetected in poultry exports. Countries that buy poultry from the US could then impose trade restrictions because of the possibility of receiving infected products. When France decided to vaccinate ducks against bird flu in October 2023, the US and Canada banned certain French poultry imports. Those bans were partially lifted in January, after the French government was able to ensure safe trade.",
                "In the US, poultry vaccination would likely focus on egg-laying chickens, as opposed to broiler chickens, which are raised for meat. During the current outbreak, more than 77 percent of the domestic poultry affected have been commercial egg-laying hens. In a USDA press release, Rollins said the agency is considering a \u201ctargeted and thoughtful strategy\u201d for vaccination.",
                "But the broiler chicken industry worries that even targeted vaccination of laying chickens would hurt the US, which is the second-largest exporter of poultry meat. Ashley Peterson, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, says other countries are likely to ban all US poultry products, even if the US only vaccinates laying chickens. \u201cWhen you move to a vaccine, you are essentially saying the virus is endemic and this is how we\u2019re going to cope with it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would prefer to not cope with the virus. We would prefer to eliminate it completely.\u201d",
                "The organization supports the USDA\u2019s current policy of culling infected flocks, as well as increasing biosecurity on farms\u2014measures such as quarantining newly acquired animals, wearing protective clothing in poultry houses, disinfecting footwear before entering animal areas, and cleaning farm equipment.",
                "But Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, says biosecurity alone is unlikely to eliminate bird flu. \u201cFarmers are so fatigued from hearing about biosecurity because they\u2019re doing everything they can already,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout more information about how those birds are getting infected, it\u2019s very difficult to target biosecurity correctly.\u201d",
                "The virus can be carried in and out of poultry barns on shoes, clothes, and equipment that moves in and out of poultry barns. Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.",
                "With the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.\u201d",
                "Even if vaccination doesn\u2019t always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that\u2019s circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.",
                "And trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. \u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,\u201d he says."

He noted that measles parties and chickenpox parties were more common practices decades ago, before vaccines for both diseases were available. But he again warned about the dangers today. \u201cPlease don't do that. It's just foolishness; it's playing roulette,\u201d he said.",

Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. \u201cWhich is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there,\u201d Wells said.",

And that's from the inflammation in the lungs,\u201d Cook said. In some patients, their oxygen is so low they need supplemental oxygen or intubation and ventilator support, which can lead to antibiotic use to ward off secondary bacterial infections, he explained.",

                " summer morning at Princeton University, aerospace engineer Aimy Wissa was at the university helipad, preparing to fly a remote-controlled plane. But this wasn\u2019t just any model aircraft. Across the top of its wings, Wissa and her team had carefully attached three rows of thin, flexible plastic flaps, hinged with tape.",
                "Guided by a mini flight computer once up in the air, the 1.5-meter-wide aircraft repeatedly performed a test maneuver\u2014gradually pitching its nose up until it lost lift and became unstable, a condition known as ",
                ". As data streamed in from the plane\u2019s onboard sensors, Wissa observed that with the help of these flaps, the stall occurred more gradually and only when the plane\u2019s nose was at a higher angle. The flaps were preventing sudden drops in lift and improving overall stability.",
                "The inspiration for this experiment had come from the original masters of the air: birds. Years before, in a graduate class at Princeton, Wissa had stumbled upon a video of a gannet flying through gusty wind. She noticed small feathers underneath the bird\u2019s wings popping out in unusual ways. Unlike the larger contour and flight feathers that streamline a bird\u2019s body, these covert feathers are smaller, softer, and arranged in layers, like overlapping shingles on a roof. They tend to stay flat during normal flight, but when a bird performs quick turns or landings, these covert feathers lift slightly, helping the bird control turbulence.",

                "\u201cWe started thinking if we can use the same elements that make bird flight so agile and maneuverable to improve our engineering systems,\u201d says Girguis Sedky, one of Wissa\u2019s former students, who now works as an aerospace engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm in California.",
                "While air crashes caused by stalling or loss of control are relatively rare, particularly in commercial aviation, they can be catastrophic. Pilot error, mechanical issues, and turbulence can all cause an aircraft to stall or lose control and plunge from the sky.",
                "By investigating how multiple rows of covert feathers function, and then replicating their effect using small, flexible plastic flaps, Wissa and her team have demonstrated that their bioinspired design could improve aircraft stability, laying the groundwork for possibly scaling up such designs for full-scale aircraft in the future. Unlike traditional flaperons on airplane wings, which are mechanically controlled, the team\u2019s flaps run along the top of the length of the wingspan and move freely in response to airflow without sensors or actuators, much like covert feathers on a bird\u2019s wing. In Wissa\u2019s model aircraft, when it encountered turbulence or high angles of attack, the flaps lifted automatically, subtly adjusting airflow to enhance stability and lift.",
                "The team\u2019s work builds on a rich but dormant tradition of taking aviation inspiration from birds. In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci began sketching flying machines inspired by birds\u2019 wing movements. The late 19th century saw ",

Lilienthal also wrote detailed case studies on how bird flight could be translated to the aviation industry, greatly influencing later engineers, including the Wright brothers.

                "Over time, however, aerospace engineers started thinking that they had surpassed the need to look at nature at all. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 species of bats, and more than 10,000 species of birds, yet most flying species have never been studied. \u201cWe may know their names, the eggs they lay, or their habitats, but we don\u2019t know how they fly,\u201d Lentink says. This is a huge missed opportunity, he believes, because studying animal flights enables researchers to think outside the box. It can bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.",
                "Wissa noticed that previous studies had looked into covert-feather-inspired single flaps and how these contributed to air flow\u2014but birds don\u2019t just have one covert feather, they have multiple rows that interact with each other. There was very little research seeking to understand those interactions, the underlying physics behind their impact on airflow, and how the flaps could be integrated into a prototype aircraft.",
                "Wissa\u2019s team began by placing a single hinged flap at different positions along a wing\u2019s upper surface. Using a wind tunnel, they then measured aerodynamic forces and airflow speeds around the wing. \u201cWhen we placed the flap in different spots, it shifted the airflow distinctly, offering some lift benefits,\u201d Sedky explains. They realized they could amplify these effects by simply adding more flaps.",

                "The team then started looking into multiple rows of flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified, and realized that adding more ended up enhancing certain airflow mechanisms. To test the effects of this on an actual prototype aircraft, they brainstormed over materials suitable for mounting. They settled on using lightweight, flexible plastic film to replicate covert feathers\u2019 natural stiffness and mass. \u201cThe idea was to really simplify the transfer [of the idea] from biology to engineering,\u201d Wissa says.

                "Wissa and her colleagues then tested the flaps in specific scenarios, such as when an airplane needed to immediately land on a short runway or if it encountered sudden gusts of wind. Maintaining control when an airplane\u2019s wing is at a high angle to the incoming air is critical\u2014not only for stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling.

                ". Passive advancements could not only help with this, but would do so without depending on complex electronic systems.",
                "Yet the path to getting such technology adopted commercially is challenging\u2014and this has been the case for a lot of other animal-inspired technologies. For instance, in the 1980s, ",
                " that sharks have small protrusions, called riblets, covering their bodies, which reduce drag as they glide through water. They wondered if applying a similar design to aircraft could significantly cut fuel consumption. In 1997, ",
                " that the shark-skin-style riblets can reduce drag on airplanes by nearly 10 percent. However, commercial testing on real aircraft didn\u2019t begin until 2016.",
                "Lufthansa Technik, a German aerospace company, eventually developed ",
                ", an aircraft surface technology inspired by shark skin. \u201cToday, 25 aircraft across seven airlines have been modified with our sharkskin technology, and the number is steadily growing,\u201d says Lea Klinge, spokesperson at Lufthansa Technik. She adds that such innovations require decades of research, and that integrating new solutions into existing fleets without disrupting operations remains a major challenge.",
                "When considering how to scale these feather-inspired flaps, \u201cthere are some logistical challenges in terms of what kind of materials we can make those flaps out of or how we can properly attach them to the wings,\u201d Wissa says. And rolling out such an innovation would not be as simple as adding the plastic film to the small prototype aircraft in the team\u2019s experiment. \u201cOftentimes, integrating innovative solutions at a commercial level can quickly become complex and multidisciplinary,\u201d says Ruxandra Botez, an aerospace engineer at the university ETS Montreal. An aircraft has to go through a variety of safety tests and certifications, which can easily take several years. Botez also notes that most modern aircraft are built with incremental improvements on previous models, with manufacturers reluctant to stray far from existing designs.",
                "Lentink, however, argues that focusing solely on commercial scalability is the wrong approach. He adds that if innovations with clear scalability are the only ones to be tested, researchers won\u2019t think outside the box. \u201cIf you truly want to innovate in aerospace, then you do have to come up with these completely wild ideas,\u201d he says. Staying too close to the final application limits engineers\u2019 ability to create new things. He believes that the covert-feather-inspired flaps, in their current guise, probably aren\u2019t close to immediate application. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it as criticism,\u201d he says. \u201cI see it as researchers developing critical ideas that can now be developed further in this technological pipeline towards an application.\u201d",
                "The scientists WIRED spoke to stress that the future of aircraft design must continue drawing inspiration from nature. Birds are more agile, capable, and maneuverable than anything humans have built. \u201cIf we want to create aircraft that can fly as efficiently and adaptably in unpredictable conditions, we\u2019ll inevitably need to incorporate aspects of bird flight into next-generation designs,\u201d says Sedky.",
                "Even if they don\u2019t make it onto large commercial planes, Wissa says these feather-inspired innovations could be game-changing for small aircraft, which are expected to play a major role in the future of aviation, such as in package delivery or urban air mobility\u2014there are multiple startups trying to develop flying taxi services, for example. Such aircraft will likely need to take off and land in tight spaces. These innovations could boost lift and control during such high-angle maneuvers.",
                "\u201cAs aircraft get smaller, they also become more susceptible to environmental factors like gusts, high winds, and turbulent airflows,\u201d Wissa explains. Equipped with these flaps, small flying vehicles of the future might be able to handle \u201cgusts that would have thrown an aircraft out of the sky.\u201d"

What seems to be happening now is that if you go to different doctors with multiple symptoms, you will get a name for them all. These symptoms always existed, but the naming of them has been detrimental to patients. It\u2019s caused them to pay a lot of attention to their bodies and that makes the symptoms worse. That\u2019s the nocebo effect.",

That was probably true to a point, but the improvement isn\u2019t sustained when you get into the milder end of any disease spectrum.",
                "Patients come to us wanting answers. People want to understand why they are the way they are. A satisfying consultation between a doctor and a patient is often one where the patient asks about a symptom and the doctor can explain what it is. I think it\u2019s a little bit of a collusion between what patients want and how doctors can satisfy them with labels.",
                "That\u2019s my concern. Autism has risen from like one in 2,500 people to one in 36 children in the UK and one in 20 in Northern Ireland. That happened because people realized that there must be kids out there who\u2019ve got milder forms of this, and if we help them, they\u2019ll get better.",

                "The reason it\u2019s not working is because when you get to the very mild end of a spectrum of behavioral or learning problems, you have a balancing act between the benefit of being diagnosed along with the help you can get, and the drawbacks of being diagnosed, which is telling a child that they\u2019ve got an abnormal brain. What does that do to a child\u2019s belief in themselves? How does it stigmatize them? How does it affect their identity formation? We thought it would be helpful to tell children this, but the statistics and the outcome is suggesting it isn\u2019t helpful.",
                "Every cancer screening program will lead to some people getting treatment when they didn\u2019t need to be treated. That will always be the case. What we\u2019re desperately wrangling with is that we want to make sure we keep the number of overdiagnosed people down and the number of people who need the treatment up. However, the more sensitive you make those tests, the more overdiagnosed people you will have. I read in a Cochrane review that if you screen 2,000 women, you save one life, and you over treat somewhere between 10 or 20 women. You\u2019re always overtreating way more people than lives you\u2019re actually saving. So the suggestion that we should do even more of these tests before we\u2019ve perfected the ones we have does not make sense to me.",
                "I do multiple brain scans a week and so many of them show incidental findings. Even though I\u2019m a neurologist and I see brain scans all the time, I don\u2019t know what to make of half of them. We just don\u2019t yet know how to properly interpret these scans. We need to pay more attention to detecting symptomatic disease early, rather than trying to detect asymptomatic diseases that may never progress.",
                "If you\u2019re going to go for screening\u2014and I don\u2019t want people not to go for the suggested screenings\u2014you do need to understand the uncertainties and realize you don\u2019t have to panic. Of course, the minute you hear there\u2019s some cancer cells, the panic kicks in, and you want it out and you want the maximum amount of treatment. But actually, in medicine, a lot of decisions can be made slowly. There are watchful waiting programs.",
                "I want to suggest to people that, before you go for the screening, know these uncertainties exist, so that you can decide before the test comes back positive what you think you\u2019d likely want to do, and then you can take time to think about it afterwards, and you can ask for a watchful waiting program.",
                "I think one of the solutions would be to call these abnormal cells that we find on screening something other than \u201ccancer.\u201d The moment you hear that word, people\u2019s immediate reaction is to get it out, because otherwise they think they will die of it. Watchful waiting is just something people find hard to do.",

Chan School of Public Health, she researched solutions for loneliness. At Google\u2019s health spinoff, Verily, her job was to bring people together to promote social health. \u201cI first came across the term \u2018social health\u2019 during my research at Stanford, where I was developing an app around human connection,\u201d Killam says. \u201cSince then all my work has been through the lens of connection.\u201d",

But when it\u2019s chronic, that becomes a problem. Chronic loneliness, just like chronic stress, ultimately increases cortisol, inflammation, and weakens our immune systems. We need other people in order to survive, so chronic loneliness is literally registered as a threat. In contrast, when you have supportive relationships, that calms down your body and you\u2019re able to manage stress more easily. Connection is a fundamental need that our bodies understand.",

That worries me a lot.",

In fact, the entire IM-2 mission was planned to end at this time, as the equipment's solar cells wouldn't have the energy to power the devices.
